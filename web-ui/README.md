# Web UI

Static, dependency-free front-end for mesdeparts.ch. Everything in this folder is served as-is (no build step), with ES modules and versioned filenames to keep long-lived caches safe to bust.

## Features
- Stop search with suggestions and favorites (stored locally; no account).
- Two bus views: by line (balanced by destination) or chronological; trains are always chronological.
- Filters for platform/line/train service plus “My favorites” mode.
- Board mode toggle (“Tableau”) for always-on displays; direct mode for one-off checks.
- Self-hosted SBB clock + digital clock; auto-refresh every 10–20 s (~3 h horizon).
- Multilingual (FR/DE/IT/EN), deep links via `?stationName=...&stationId=...`, installable PWA shell (API stays online).

## Entry points
- `legacy_api/web-ui/index.html`: single-board experience with language switcher, favorites, filters, and the SBB clock iframe (`clock/`).
- `legacy_api/web-ui/dual-board.html`: two boards side by side for kiosks/embeds, with separate station pickers and view/filter controls.
- `manifest.webmanifest` + `service-worker.js`: PWA shell; caches static assets, leaves API requests online-only.

## Architecture (versioned files)
- `main.v*.js`: boot; reads URL/localStorage defaults (`stationName`/`stationId`, language), wires event handlers, starts refresh + countdown loops, and toggles board/direct API mode (auto-switches back to board mode after ~2 min unless overridden).
- `state.v*.js`: shared config/constants (refresh cadence, horizons, view modes, thresholds) and mutable `appState`.
- `logic.v*.js`: transport.opendata.ch client (or Cloudflare proxy when board mode is on), station resolve/nearby search, journey details fallback, delay/remark computation, grouping/sorting, and network detection for line colors.
- `ui.v*.js`: DOM rendering of the board, clocks, station search with suggestions/nearby, filters (line/platform/train service), favorites popovers, view toggle, auto-fit watcher, and embed state publication.
- `i18n.v*.js`: minimal translations (FR/DE/IT/EN) + language persistence.
- `favourites.v*.js`: localStorage (`md_favorites_v1`) helpers; no backend.
- `infoBTN.v*.js`: info/help/realtime/credits overlay shown from the “i” button.
- `style.v*.css`: board + dual layout styles, network color tokens, popovers.
- `clock/`: self-hosted SBB clock assets (Apache 2.0); cached by the service worker for offline/instant loads.

## Data & refresh flow
- Default station is `Lausanne, motte` (id `8592082`); query params or stored values override it. Deep links use `?stationName=...&stationId=...`.
- API base defaults to `https://transport.opendata.ch/v1`; override in HTML with `window.__MD_API_BASE__ = "https://api.mesdeparts.ch";` (Cloudflare Worker cache). Board mode uses that proxy; direct mode hits the public API and auto-reverts to board mode after ~2 minutes unless explicitly kept.
- `refreshDepartures` calls `/stationboard` (limit tuned to UI), rebuilds grouped rows (3 h horizon, train/bus split, line/platform filters, favorites-only mode, train service filters) and renders. Countdown column updates every 5 s from cached data.
- Stale board guard: if the stationboard looks “empty because everything is already in the past”, the UI triggers a cache-bypassing refetch at most once per minute per station to recover from sticky caches and will fall back to a direct (non-proxy) fetch if the board stays empty for ~1 minute.
- Station search uses `/locations` (with debounced caching) and an optional geolocation helper via `/locations?x/y`. Journey details overlay falls back to `/journey` or `/connections` when `passList` is missing.
- Embeds: pages add a `dual-embed` class when framed; `publishEmbedState` exposes current board state to the parent.

## Running locally
- Static server only; no bundler needed:
  ```sh
  cd legacy_api/web-ui
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Then open http://localhost:8000.
- Tests (Node built-in): `npm test` from `legacy_api/web-ui/` (checks key helpers in `logic.*.js`). `package.json` has no deps.

## Versioning & deploy notes
- JS/CSS filenames carry a version tag (`*.vYYYY-MM-DD-N.*`). When you bump assets, update references in `index.html`, `dual-board.html`, and the `CORE_ASSETS`/`LAZY_ASSETS` lists inside `service-worker.js`, plus the visible version tags in the HTML headers.
- `service-worker.js` derives its cache name from the asset list; keep the list in sync with the actual files so cache busting remains automatic.
- The UI is fully static: host this folder on any static host (Netlify/Vercel/S3/nginx/Apache). A `.htaccess` file is not used here; rely on versioned filenames for cache control.

## Edge cache (Cloudflare Worker) — optional
- What it does: proxy in front of `transport.opendata.ch` with short TTLs to reduce upstream calls when many users watch the same stop.
- Files: `legacy_api/cloudflare-worker/worker.js`, `legacy_api/wrangler.toml` (inside `legacy_api/`). Not needed for FTP/static hosting.
- Point the UI: set `window.__MD_API_BASE__ = "https://api.mesdeparts.ch"` near the top of `index.html` to use the proxy; otherwise it calls the public API.
- Board mode uses the proxy; direct mode calls the public API and auto-reverts to board mode after ~2 minutes unless the user keeps it on.

## Behavior/UX notes
- Board mode toggle (“Tableau”) reduces API load by using the Worker cache; direct mode is faster for one-off checks. Filters/view changes are client-side only.
- Language, favorites, board mode preference, and last station are stored in `localStorage`; nothing leaves the browser.
- The service worker pre-caches the shell and serves navigations cache-first with background revalidation; API calls always hit the network.
